      <h1>How to Play Multisweeper</h1>
      <p>The goal of multisweeper is to claim the highest number of tiles possible until all non-bomb tiles are claimed at which point the player with the highest score wins.</p>
      <p>Tiles operate under the following rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tile has a 20% chance of being a bomb.</li>
        <li>The count of each tile is the sumof each bomb directly touching, including diagonal to, it.</li>
        <li>You can only see the count of the tiles you have claimed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game is best played with a mouse, a keyboard is optional.</p>
      <p>WASD, Arrow Keys, or clicking and dragging with the mouse can move the camera.</p>
      <p>Flags can be placed to remind yourself where you believe a bomb may be, outside of that they have no effect.</p>
